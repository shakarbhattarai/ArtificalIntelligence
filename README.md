#Machine Learning Programs.

I have implemented a few machine learning algorithms, and have utilized some others to come up with the following results:

1. Premeir League(Football) Winner Prediction (pl.py):

2. Quandl's data based Stock Prediction (stocks.py) :

      - Predict the closing values for stocks based on data provided by Quandl using Simple Linear Regression Algorithm.
      - Accuracy ~ 95%

3. Wine's Quality Prediction (wine.py):
      - Predict the quality(On a scale of 1 to 10) of wine based on over 12 features.(Accuracy: 73%)

#Random Artifical Intelligence Based Problems

1. Missionary Canniabl Problem (missionary_cannibal.py)
      - Algorithmic implementation (in Python) for the Missionary Cannibal Problem. Attached below is the state spaece tree for 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals. The Problem is generalized for n missionaries and n cannbials.

      ![State Space Tree for MC Problem for 10 missionaries and 10 cannnibals](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a83fP9A32qBsCAh9WkwlYnqBiqiftl7nyyJyMWvG0k_uHTXd76cCeIcUoUPiPhngCoXrlBa-Isa_TVk=w1366-h675-rw)

2. Water Jug Problem using Hill Climbing Algorithm(water_jug.py)

3. N Queen Problem (Nqueen.py)

4. 8 Puzzle(8 puzzle.py)
