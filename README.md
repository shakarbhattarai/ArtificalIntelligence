#Machine Learning Programs.

I have implemented a few machine learning algorithms, and have utilized some others to come up with the following results:

1. Premeir League(Football) Winner Prediction (pl.py):

2. Quandl's data based Stock Prediction (stocks.py) :

      - Predict the closing values for stocks based on data provided by Quandl using Simple Linear Regression Algorithm.
      - Accuracy ~ 95%
